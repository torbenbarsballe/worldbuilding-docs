# Necromancy

Necromancy refers to any usage of Animancy that manipulates the soul or essence of the (un)dead. The two primary applications of Necromancy are Imprinting and Soulbinding.

## Imprinting

A mage can use animancy to capture an imprint or magical memory of a once living being. Such entities will behave similar to how they did in life, but have no actual soul or guiding intelligence, and are instead guided by the memory of instinct or habit. The major effective difference between Imprinted and Soulbound is that Imprinted cannot learn. Additionally, Imprinting targets the body of the entity being imprinted, while Soulbinding targets the soul. The most common application of imprinting is the reanimation of corpses to create zombies. As they have no true will of their own and are instead guided by instinct, these make decent servants. However, imprinted undead will only be effective at tasks that they were good at in life.
The easiest and most common application of imprinting is to place the imprint upon the body it is based on, to create a zombie. However, imprinting can be used to capture an imprint of an entity into other vessels. If an imprint is imbued into a static vessel, it will result in a ghost, which will generally only manifest mentally. If an imprint is imbued into an artificial body, it will create an imprinted golem. Imprinted golems are generally physically stronger and more durable than a zombie, but also harder to animate and tend to be clumsier because they do not have the same physical body as the being they were imprinted with.
Imprinting does not work with elementals because they don’t have a conventional body (and are instead physical objects animated by a magical force) from which to base an imprint on. 

## Soulbinding

Soulbinding is similar to imprinting but substantially more difficult. A sufficiently skilled mage can use animancy to transfer the soul of a living being into another repository. This is easiest at the moment of death of the natural body of the soul in question, and unlike imprinting cannot be done if the target entity is already dead. Soulbound retain all knowledge, skills and abilities they had in life, and are fundamentally the same person as they where when alive. Consequently, any soulbound entity is effectively immortal until their vessel is destroyed.
If soulbinding is used to place the soul of an entity into their own dead body, the result is known as a revenant. If soulbinding is used by a mage to place their own soul into their own body (or any other vessel), the resulting entity is generally reffered to as a lich.
If soulbinding is used to place a soul into an artificial body, the result is known as a soulbound golem. Soulbound are much more effective than imprinted golems, as the soulbound mind is capable of learning and adapting to the new body.
Because a soulbound retains all their knowledge and skills, and is capable of learning and adapting, soulbinding is sometimes used to trap the soul of someone into a static object, in order to provide access to their knowledge, skills, and abilities indefinitely.
Soulbinding can also be used to trap the essence of an elemental into an object, in order to create items that can manifest powerful and unique elemental effects without substantial effort from the caster, or to create totems that can be used to “summon” the captured elemental. Note that soulbinding a lesser elemental is substantially easier than soulbinding an animal or a person.

Temporary Reanimation: Quicker and easier than full reanimation, but requires the full concentration of the reanimating mage. A single mage cannot readily transition between temporary and full reanimation.

A mage specializing in necromancy is known as a Necromancer, and is generally a learned mage.

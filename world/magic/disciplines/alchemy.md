# Alchemy

Alchemy is essentially chemistry applied to natural and magical materials. It includes the creation of any materials with magical properties. While in many ways similar to enchanting, it differs in that Enchanting is the application of any given affect to some object, whereas Alchemy is the creation of some effect using the existing properties of various materials (Although many alchemists also use enchanting to enhance their products). Additionally, Alchemists do not need to have any magical skill, although magic (primarily sympathy and enchanting) can be used to identify, supplement, or enhance certain effects.
There are two main alchemical disciplines:

## Metallurgy
 
Metallurgy is the use of minerals and metals in Alchemy. Products of metallurgy include magical alloys, gunpowder and other incendiary variations, and materials with specific melting or boiling points, conductivity, refractivity or reflectivity, or other physical properties.

## Herbalism
 
Herbalism is the use of plant and animal products to create tinctures, salves, and potions with various effects. This includes both natural effects (eg. Willow bark tea as a painkiller) and magical effects (eg. A Mana Bloom potion to enhance available arcana). Herbalism also includes the creation of various poisons. 

There is some overlap between metallurgy and herbalism, especially in the creation of acids, solvents, adhesives, and noxious gasses.
Basic alchemy favors instinctive magic, and most nonmagical alchemists gradually develop some basic magical power, which manifests in the form of more powerful or more perfect substances.
A mage specializing in alchemy is known as an Alchemist, or more specifically as a Metallurgist or an Herbalist. Metallurgists are most commonly learned mages while Herbalists are most commonly instinctive mages, although most Herbalists do have an extensive knowledge of the natural effects of all the ingredients they use.

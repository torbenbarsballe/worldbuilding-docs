# Animancy

Animancy is the manipulation of an entities soul or life essence. 

It can be used to travel outside of ones body in an invisible and incorporeal form. Animancy is also used to help maintain ones identity when shapeshifting into another form. Animancy is used to bind souls or soul echoes into undead and constructs in order to animate them. The manipulation of souls other than ones own or the souls of the recently dead is extremely difficult. Animancy can also be used in conjunction with psionics and encantation to bind the soul of one entity into the service of another.

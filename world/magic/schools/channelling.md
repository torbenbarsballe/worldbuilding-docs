# Channelling

Channeling is the transport of matter and energy from one place to
another. 

Effects achieved through channeling must obey conservation of energy and momentum (One exception to this rule is teleportation, which tends to break potential energy - this consumes (or produces) a comesurate amount of Arcana via Evocation). Channeling is useful for focusing large but diffuse energy sources such as ambient heat, and for diverting energy around or past an object. This can be used to divert light around oneself to achieve invisibility, and to project sounds or images of existing objects to other nearby locations. More powerful spellcasters can use channeling for teleportation.

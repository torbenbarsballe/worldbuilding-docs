# Transmutation

Transmutation is the transformation of matter and energy from one form into another. 

The greater the dissimilarity between the two forms, the more difficult the transmutation is. In addition, more complex materials are more difficult to transmute. Transmutation is often used for spells requiring a material that is not present, such as supplying fuel to a fireball spell. Transmutation is also one of the primary components of shapeshifting.

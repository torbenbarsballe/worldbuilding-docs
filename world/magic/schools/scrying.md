# Scrying

Scrying is the observation of that which is unseen or far away. 

It can be used to sense magic and energy, and see through walls or other barriers. It can also be used to observe the past, present, future, or far away places, but this usually requires a sympathetic link to what you are trying to see, and scrying the future is always difficult and unreliable.

# Evocation

Evocation is the creation and absorption of matter and energy.

Evocation is generally limited to small-scale effects, as all energy for the spell must come directly from Arcana. Evocation tends to be 'faster' to cast than comparable channeling or transmutation effects, and is therefore useful for reactive spells. It is also useful for small effects that supplement more complex spells, such as generating a spark to ignite a fireball, or creating certain precise light patterns for a physical illusion.

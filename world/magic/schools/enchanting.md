# Enchanting

Enchanting the binding of magical effect into objects.

There are three basic subtypes of enchantment: Triggered enchantments, template enchantments, and permanent or ongoing enchantments.

* Triggered enchantments store a single spell that takes effect when triggered. This can include single-use scrolls, certain potions, and single use magical traps.
* Template enchantments are used to store an imprint of a spell, which allows another mage to cast that spell without having prior knowledge of the spell (The mage must still supply all energy for the spell). Many wands have this kind of enchantment, and most spellbooks also include template enchantments of all spells contained within.
* Permanent enchantments are ongoing effects that function independently from the caster. These enchantments can either draw Arcana from their surroundings (in which case they will be limited in power by the availability of ambient Arcana), or can be provided with a certain amount of arcane upon creation (in which case they will have a limited duration). A simple example of this sort of enchanting would be a permanent magical light source, perhaps using transmutation to convert heat into light. 

Most powerful artifacts tend to use some form of permanent enchantment, sometimes combined with trigger or template effects. These type of enchantments tend to be very complicated to create, and equally difficult to alter or undo. 

There is also a subset of permanent enchantments that are self-replicating. This includes magical afflictions such as lycanthropy, as well as hereditary curses. These kinds of enchantments use a permanent enchantment to handle the basic effects, and use an integrated template enchantment in order to replicate.

Fauna comprise the kingdom Anima. Members of this kingdom have some form of nervous system and are generally mobile. They gain energy by consuming other organisms.
Anima consists of three phyla:

## Cercis (Jellies)
Members of this phylum are radialy symmetric, and have a simple, redundant internal structure.
This phylum includes jellyfish, squids and krakens, and wurms.

## Concha (Shells)
Members of concha are supported by an external skeleton and generally have a simple nervous system.
This phylum includes insects and similar.

## Spina (Vertebrates)
Members of this phylum have a central spinal column, an internal skeleton, and are bilaterally symmetric. Members of Spina generally have a relatively complex physiology.
This phylums includes serpentfish, lonfeather birds, raptors, and mamillians.


In addition to these three phyla, there are two additional classifications not associated with a phylum.

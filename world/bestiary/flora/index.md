# Flora

Flora includes all members of the kingdom Vita. Members of this kingdom generate energy through photosynthesis, have no nervous system and are generally immobile. Fauna reproduce sexually or asexually using seeds or spores.

Vita consists of  four phyla:

## Fungi

Members of this phylum are fleshy, spore-producing plants that obtain sustenance from decomposing matter. They include lichen, molds, and mushrooms.

## Mosses

Members of this phylum are small, leafy plants that grow in large clumps or mats. They do not produce flowers and reproduce via spores.

## Conifers and Cycads

Members of this phylum are nonflowering plants that reproduce from seeds in cones. They have tough waxy leaves and vary in size from small shrubs to immense trees.

## Flowering Plants

Members of this phylum reproduce sexually by spreading pollen between flowers. These flowers then produce seeds, often in the form of fruits. They have broad leaves and include small flowers, shrubs, and deciduous trees.

# Materials

In adition to their natural properties, many conventional materials
interact in unique ways with magical phenomena. The magical nature of
this world also results in a number of unique magical materials.

## Metals

Magically, metals tend to be good at holding enchantments or directly
manipulating magic. Metals tend to be poor at holding sympathetic
bonds, due to their maleable, uniform nature.

## Alloys

Alloys are combinations of one or more metals, and often have unique
properties. Many alloys also contain trace amounts of magical materials
ond other nonmetals.

## Alchemical Materials

By combining various magical and nonmagical materials, alchemists can
create materials with potent magical effects, without need for a mage.

## Organics

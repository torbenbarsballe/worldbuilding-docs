# Sympathy

Sympathy the use relationships between physical things to enable other spellcasting.

Sympathy can be used to link two similar objects, link part of an object with the rest of it, or link an object with its past or future. 
This useful for targeting long distance spells such as teleportation or scrying using some part of the target. 
Sympathy can also be used to copy or extrapolate the structure of an object. This can be used to simplify complex spells such as shapeshifting (by interpolating the full physiology of an animal from a piece of bone) or healing (by linking to the past state of the targets body). 

Sympathy can also be used to reduce the arcana required by a spell by using a sympathetic focus of a material related to the effect of the spell.
When using Sympathy to supplement channeling, evocation, or transmutation that involves the manipulation of some form of energy, a good sympathetic focus is an object that has experienced the same kind of energy. For example, diamionds and igneous/metamorphic rocks are good focci for heat spells.
Metals tend to be good sympathetic focci for general encantation and enchanting spells.
For scrying, fire is a good focus for future sight, earth for past sight, and water and air are good for distance sight (water generally gives a clearer vision while air tends to have a longer and broader range). Molten rock is a very strong scrying focus as it combines all the (relevant) attributes of these four elements. Glass or reflective surfaces are good for revealing hidden things.

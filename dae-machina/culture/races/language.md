Most modern Ael languages are based in aldar, but most have diverged substantially.
 
The 'jinn language is the closest to the origional Aeldar, and uses to the same script.

The 'daal language has evolved somewhat, and has a phonetic script. The
'midh language is similar, and has a runic phonetic script.
 
The 'thal and 'xhal languages have both diverged substantially from the
origional Aeldar, but are quite similar to each other. They both use
unique symbolic scripts.

## Æl'fae languages

The 'fae have their own unique language, similar to both conventional animal communication and human language and tailored towards communication between two forms. Different tribes use different dialects, but the language structure is the same.
Primary constituents:
* **Vocalizations**. Æl'fae use a fairly simple proto-language that can be spoken in either form. It is used primarily for quick commands or queries, and long distance communications. It is not a complete language, and is insufficient for comunicationg more complex concepts.
* **Body Language**. Much of the more subtle communication between 'fae occurs through body language. This body language is fairly similar to that of the respective base forms, so they are also farly good at picking up cues from regular humans and animals.
* **Symbols**. Most 'fae also use a fairly basic collection of symbols for marking territory and other locations of value. These symbols are intended to be producible in both human and animal form, usually by scratching/carving them into wood or stone. Given the diversity of predatory fae among the Plains 'fae, many plains tribes wear a woven armband indicating their tribe, intended to differentiate them from regular animals to predatory fae or human hunters.

Æl'fae rely on scent based communication much less than regular animals. While 'fae in human-form have a better sense of smell, it is still far inferior to most animals. Consequently, while they will take advantage of smell while in their animal form, they do not rely on it much for communication.

The feline jungle 'fae (xhal'fae) have a single hybrid form. Consequently, their language is much simpler - they have a more conventional vocal language, resembling a gutteral dialect of the 'xhal language.

Many Æl'fae are also able speak the common tongue of their region while in human form.

Given its fairly complex nature, very few non-fae are capable of speaking 'fae dialects.

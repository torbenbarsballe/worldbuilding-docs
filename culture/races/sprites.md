# Sprites

Sprites are 8-inch tall humanoids with insectlike wings. Both both butterfly-winged and dragonfly-winged variants exist, with the butterfly-winged Sprites commonly refered to as Faeries.
Sprites have digitigrade feet, with long clawed toes. Their forearms and lower legs have stiff, carapace-like skin, with segmented digits.
Sprites have faceted monochromatic eyes, long pointed ears, and a pair of antennae. Their hair is stiff, and vaugely resembles primitive feathers.

They are short lived, clever, but not highly intelligent (ie. Good ‘street smarts’ poor ‘book learning’). Natural habitats are bogs, swamps or marshes. Many sprites make their home in human cities as messengers, spies, and other jobs related to their unique physiology.

Sprites are quite short-lived. They reach adulthood at 2 years, and old age at 14. Sprites rarely live past 18.

# Æl'mið 

(Artificers - European)
Northern; Norse/Celtic. Tall, strongly built with red or blond hair (wavy),
and blue, green, or purple eyes. Gifted smiths and enchanters, also
great warriors; 

Some groups of midh use enchanted tattoos/warpaint (woad). This is used
to apply an enchantment to a person. Warpaint is temporary but easier
to accomplish. Tattos are effectively permanent but are much more
difficult.

Basic warpaint enchantments:

  * Stoneskin
  * Flame cloak
  * Aura of cold
  * Antimagic Aura

More advanced enchantments:

  * Regeneration/Healing
  * Enhanced Speed/Strength
  * Shield Spell
  * Rust Aura
  * Shapeshifting
  * Invisibility
  * Time Distortion
  * Illusion

Notable Æl'míð nations:

* Runesea Isles <drais'agean iles> - Specialist in tattoos
(Runeblooded <draisblodh>. Also refered to demeaning as
* scrivesblodh/scraelsblodh )
* Hollow mountains - Æl'míð and Æl'jinn city in a hollowed out mountain. More southerly than most Æl'míð cities.
* Drakkar - Barbarian clans
* Mountain strongholds - Best smiths.

#Æl'thal

(Western Humans - Quasi-asian)
Pale to olive skin. Blond or platinum-bloned hair. Green, blue, or amber eyes.
The Æl'thal are descended from an offshoot of the Ældar civilization
that colonized the eastern continent about 20,000 years ago. The
Æl'thal have a different physical appearance and language than
the Æl'daal or the Æl'midh, but are physiologically quite similar.

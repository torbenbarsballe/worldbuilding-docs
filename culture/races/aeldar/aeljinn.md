# Æl'jinn

The Æl'jinn are a race of elemental shapeshifters. Similar to the
Æl'fae, they originated from an Ældar offshoot that primarily
practiced elemental magic circa 1,000 BC. Early Æl'jinn were naturally
skilled at elemental magic, and often took elemental familiers. Over
the course of many generations, the the magical skills of the Æl'jinn
gradually became natural talents. The most prominent of these is the
ability to transform their bodies into elemental forms. Modern Æl'jinn
are humanoid, with strong elemental abilities and the ability to shift
all or part of their form into some element. Most 'jinn retain a
part-human, part-elemental form. Æl'jinn are highly intelligent, and
very long lived. While their human form ages at a slightly reduced
natural rate, 'jinn do not age in their elemental form. Consequently,
elder 'jinn tend to spend more and more time in their elemental forms,
to the extent that the oldest 'jinn are always in their elemental form.
Half-jinn, and other weaker 'jinn who cannot shift into a full
elemental form die of old age at about 100 to 200 years.
Their are four main 'jinn subraces, originating from the four founding
families of the original Ael'jinn and representing the four classical
elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth.

Fire: Fire 'jinn have black, auburn, or red hair. Their hair often
incorporates perpetual flames. Their skin color ranges from black, to
brown, to reddish brown. Their irisis are blue, purple, red, or amber.
Fire 'jinn clothing tends to be minimalistic, and primarially composed
of metals and other fireproof materials such as salamander leather or
(rarely) dragonhide, although their clothing also often incorporates
cloth tassels. They also tend to wear lots of jewelry, often
incorporating diamond, ruby and/or quartz.

Air: Air 'jinn have blonde, silver, or white hair, pale tan or light
blue skin, and blue or grey irises. Air 'jinn clothing is primarily
comprised of ornate layered robes, usually with tassels and ribbons
that will float dramatically in the wind. 

Water: Water 'jinn have blond, brown, or red hair, tan skin, and green
or blue irises. Water 'jinn clothing is minimalistic and often
diaphanous. It is usually comprised of cloth that dries quickly. Water
'jinn jewelry often incorporates ocean products such as pearl, abalone,
and coral.

Earth: Earth 'jinn have brown or black skin, brown or black hair, and
green, blue, or amber eyes. Male earth 'jinn are often bald, or wear
their hair very short. Earth 'jinn generally wear ornate robes or
togas. Unique among the 'jinn, earth 'jinn retain a humanoid from when
fully shape-shifted.

In addition to the four founding families, there are a number of other 'jinn sub-races and hybrids.
Shadow 'jinn shapeshift into a black smoke that absorbs ambient light.
They have a natural affinity for air and fire. Shadow 'jinn are usually
dark skinned. 
All shadow 'jinn belong to a single extended family originating from the first 'jinn, and as such are rather rare.
Sand 'jinn shapeshift into a cloud of sand. They are most common in
desert regions, and have a natural affinity for earth and air. Most
sand 'jinn are indistinguishable from earth 'jinn in their human form.
Storm 'jinn shapeshift into thunderclouds, and air capable of
projecting rain and lightning. They have a natural affinity for air and
water, and are about as common as any of the four founding 'jinn
families. Storm 'jinn are most similar to air 'jinn in appearance, but
may have darker coloration.

The offspring of 'jinn of two different types may manifest one of the elements of their parents, or may have a hybrid form.
Magma 'jinn originate from earth and fire 'jinn, and can transform
their body into molten rock of varying temperature. Magma 'jinn are
fairly rare
Clay 'jinn originate from earth and water 'jinn, and can transform their body into mud or clay. Clay 'jinn are quite rare.
In addition to being a 'jinn sub-race in their own right, storm 'jinn
can originate from air and water 'jinn or from fire and water 'jinn.
Similarly, sand 'jinn can originate from earth and air 'jinn parents.
Pyroclast 'jinn can shapeshift into hot, noxious smoke, and are the
descendants of air and fire 'jinn. They are somewhat similar to shadow
'jinn.

Celestial 'jinn have an affinity for three or more elements (High
Celestial 'jinn have an affinity for all four of the classical
elements). Celestial 'jinn shapeshift into a cloud of smoke and dust,
interspersed with lightning, crystals, and small glowing balls of
plasma. Their precise attributes vary depending on their elemental
affinities. Celestial 'jinn almost always remain in a half form, with a
humanoid torso, and a pillar of smoke in place of their legs. Celestial
'jinn are uniquely well-suited to countering the abilities of other
'jinn due to their larger range of abilities. The offering of celestial
'jinn are almost always also celestial 'jinn, regardless of the
elemental affinity of their other parent.

Since all 'jinn are powerful elemental mages, many things that would be
accomplished by other races using technology are accomplished solely by
magic by the 'jinn. Heat and light are provided by eternal fire and/or
magma. Heavy lifting, mining, smithing, and architecture are all
accomplished by the magic of earth-aligned 'jinn. Water, Ice, and
weather 'jinn manage plumbing, refrigeration and climate control. The
only conventional technologies 'jinn employ are related to farming and
textiles. Most 'jinn cities are found in mountainous or volcanic
regions due to the mix of elements &#8211; Air, snow and ice at the peak of
the mountain, stone thorough, and in the case of volcanic mountains
fire and magma at the core of the mountain.

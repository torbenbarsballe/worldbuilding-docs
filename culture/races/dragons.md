# Dragons

Dragons look like large winged lizards. They have a long neck and tail, four legs with opposable claws on each foot, and a pair of batlike wings. Most dragons are skilled sorcerers, and often use magic to appear to “breathe” elemental blasts like fire or ice. Dragons tend to be quite intelligent. All dragons have a tendency towards hoarding, although individual dragons will hoard different things. Many dragons hoard gems, gold, or wealth, but others may hoard magical artifacts, art, or knowledge. Because of their size and large appetite, dragons tend to be solitary, with territories ranging in size from 20,000 to 100,000 square kilometers (this is equivalent to a circular region with radius 80 to 180 kilometers). As a consequence, the global dragon population is around 1000 – 3000 dragons. Dragons will sometimes form agreements with the humans living in their area, usually something along the lines of the dragon not attacking their cities in return for a regular tribute of meat. Dragons usually eat large herd animals such as deer or sheep, although they may eat humans if given cause to. Dragons have their own spoken language, but can often speak and write in a variety of human languages. Many dragons are philosophers and researchers, devoting a great deal of time to unraveling how some aspect of the universe works. There have also been a number of dragon warlords and conquerors who have taken over local human civilizations over the ages, although these have generally limited their conquests to within their own territories. Since dragons are solitary and have an extremely low population density, there is no real dragon civilization, although some dragons have contributed to the success of certain human civilizations.

Some dragons can shapeshift into a human(like) form. When they shapeshift, they retain their mass (with a corresponding increase in density), and much of their original strength, as well as all their magical abilities. Due to the complex nature of this transmutation, it takes rather more time (around an hour) than conventional shapehifting.

## Dragon Subspecies:

### Plated (Mountain) Dragon

Large (20-40 m long) dragons with a long neck and tail and a bulky torso and legs. Their head narrows to a vertical ridge at the front and has a single armor plate on top. Their hide is covered in large, interlocking armor plates, especially along the neck, spine, underbelly, and tail. The legs are covered in smaller scales, and the wings are broad and leathery. The tail of mountain dragons tends to be broad and has an enlarged/swolen tip.
Mountain dragons are generally some combination of red, orange, grey, or black in color, generally with a darker spine and lighter underbelly and wing membranes.
Mountain dragons prefer to live in steep, rocky mountains, caves, and volcanic regions. Compared to other dragons, mountain dragons are relatively poor fliers, but very good at tunnelling.

### Horned (Greater) Dragon

Larger, found in mountain and cliff regions near savannah and plains. Long hind legs and broad, raptorlike talons. Gold, bronze, or copper in color.

### Spined Dragon

Smallest, prefers jungle and forest regions. Green, orange, or yellow in color. Also found in cliffs and canyons, usually with a brown or tan coloration.

### Western (Forest) Dragon

Small (10-30 m) dragons with a long, serpentine body and short legs. They usually have two pairs (four total) of antler-like horns on the back of their head, and a rounded snout. Forest dragons have a long wingspan, but relatively narrow wings. Their body is covered in small scales, with larger plates on their underbelly. They often have a feathery mane and tail.
Forest dragons are usually green and/or blue in color, often in a mottled pattern. Their hide may also contain traces of yellow, orange, and silver.
Forest dragons are primarily found in rainfores regions on the western continent and the Xhal isles. They generally hunt medium sized rainforest animals (deer, pigs, monkeys) and will also catch fish. Like tundra dragons, they are capable swimmers.

### Tundra Dragon

Hunts elk, reindeer and occasionally aquatic mammals. White, blue, or grey in color. Similar in appearance to spined dragons, but bulkier and with shorter spines and horns.

# High Elementals

High elementals include all elementals that can be considered sapient.
Many large, ancient elementals eventually develop sapience, but are still usually governed by their fundamental natures.

In addition to these elementals, there are two types of elementals that are inherently sapient: 

## Gyldraed

Gyldraed are elementals of a location. They have human-level intelligence, and are devoted solely to the defense and wellbeing of their domain. Their “body”, technically encompasses the entirety of they domain, but they will commonly manifest an avatar within their domain, especially when interacting with others. If their domain is respected, they are not hostile, but if their domain is threatened in any way they will do everything within their considerable power to remove the threat. Gyldraed can manipulate anything that is part of their domain, reshaping and altering it at will. They can make trees and rocks move, and can exert a limited mental influence over any animals native to their domain. Gyldraed cannot speak, but can communicate mentally. They generally communicate in termes of concepts, feelings, and visions of present or potential events rather than using words.
Gyldraed may come into being in any natural region that has a fairly stable terrain (in other words, that hasn’t changed significantly over the last few millennia) and a reasonably high concentration of magic. Gyldraed will live for as long as their domain remains in existence. Gyldraed are relatively common.

## Vyldarthe

Vyldarthe are similar to Gyldraed in intelligence and power, but are not linked to a domain and instead tend to wander across the land. They seem to crave new places and experiences, and rarely remain in one place for long. Like Gyldraed, they cannot speak, but are capable of communicating mentally. They are also quite rare.

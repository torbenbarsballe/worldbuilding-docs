   Eaosian mages begin researcing necromancy, in an attemt to form tireless zombie soldiers with no need for food.

# Ælmos - Ancient Æl’daal civilization
Centered in what is now the great Eos desert. 
Ruins – mostly tombs or mausoloeams. Obelisks and large statues are common. Step pyramids rare but present. Tombs usually have undead guardians (zombies + a sleep/wake spell. Generally have ornate animal death masks. Some tombs house liches.

# Uon War
Primarily Uon vs. Æl’daal & ‘jinn. Æl’fae avoided major conflicts, but some groups did participate in guerilla tactics against the Uon. A relatively small number of midh actually fought, but they did make many of the weapons for the ‘daal and ‘jinn. This may have led to the founding of the hollow cities?
Vetrans of the Uon war still alive as of 100 AC include ‘jinn, dragons, some archmagi, any immortals (Liches, eldar fae, etc.)

# Necromancer County

Founded by a three of journeyman mages who delved into necromancy. Most
spent some time at the AoM&MA, and several also spent time in the
Free Cities.

The county that they took over was previously wiped out by a plague.
These (relatively benign) necromancers reanimated the inhabitants
(mostly farmers, plus some guards). Partly an experiment on the part of
the necromancers in reanimating skilled labor, and in 'automated' or
'free' farming. For a group of necromancers, the members of this
organization, are rather moral and refrain from murder, theft, and most
other illegal activities (exceptions are gravrobbing and certain
methods relating to obtaining forbidden, secret, or taboo knowledge
related to necromancy). In addition to the three founders, the county
has various accolytes, mostly necromancers (usually closer to the moral
side of the alignment scale), and a few agricultural mages and non-mage
researchers.

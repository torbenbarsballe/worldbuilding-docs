# Academy of Magical and Martial Arts

One of the larges schools of magic on the western continent. Provides
training in Magic, Combat, and Magic/Combat synergy. It is note solely
militaristic, and has a very well developed academic/research branch.
It is based in the Mediteranean kingdom, but independent. However, it
is sponsored by the Eaon kingdom and the Eldar Council. As part of this
sponsorship, the Eon kingdom will pay the complete tuition of a student
in return for 10(?) years of military service.
Located at (22 N, 32 E).







Main Spire - Center
Tower Wings - Two quarter cylindrical shells, terminating in towers
Student/Journeyman quarters.
Shapeshifter Wing - Inexperienced shapeshifters tend to be somewhat
influenced by animal instincts. This, coupled with the frequent nudity
and loss of nudity taboo that generally results from learning basic
shapeshifting means that this wing tends to be quite unrestrained -
shapeshifted or nude students are rather common in the hallways, and
sex between these students (in human or animal form) is rather common.
Lower levels include kitchens, servants quarters
Terminating towers include astronomy tower and ...
Central Tower - Alumni offices and quarters. Conference rooms. Teleportation stone/spire
Underground Bathhouse (Geothermal Pools)

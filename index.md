One hundred years ago, the Xuon continent was shattered by a great
cataclysm, when the Uon atempted to birth an artifical god. This event
wiped out the Uon, and heralded the end of the great Uon - Ã†l war.
Now, Xuon is a shattered realm, ravaged by wild magic. Fractured islands float
above a chaotic sea. The air is thick with magic, spawning
elementals and distorting the nature of reality itself.

In the land of Eaos, the Elmos Republic has begun to rebuild after the
war, and are a bastion of strength and stability after these troubled
times.
To the north, the Futhern Dal remain locked in their mountain
strongholds, toiling in their mines and forges while bandits ravage the
countryside.
To the south, The lords of the Free Cities continue their endless
squabbling over wealth and power, while the Riftlanders scour the ruins
left behind by the Xoun cataclysm for artifacts of immense power.
Further east, the 'jinn have withdrawn into isolation.
Meanwhile, rumours arise of a forgotten empire across the western sea, set on conquest.

Amidst these nations, other dangers flourish. 
Vast battlefields, left in the wake of the Uon war, are haunted by the ghosts of the fallen.
Shapeshifters roam the forests and plains, indifferent to the vagaries of human politics.
Dragons dwell in the highest mountains, wielding immeasurable power.
The wilderness is beset by rogue elementals, wild and uncontrollable.
This is the world of Dael.

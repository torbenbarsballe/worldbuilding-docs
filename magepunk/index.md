## Other Creatures

### Outsiders

Known by many names - Outsiders, Outlanders, Deep Ones, Forgotten Ones, Unknown Ones. 
Much of the modern rune-magic is based upon inscriptions found in mysterous ruins though to originate from these outsiders.

Outsiders are native to multidimensional space (N > 3) adjacent to our own.
Misuse (deliberate or not) of these runes can cause cause Outsiders to cross over to our realm.
Becuase they are native to multidimensional space, they tend to move through 3-space in strange and unnatural ways, as well as move through solid matter.
Sometimes their bodies even appear to be composed on disjoint parts.

Some outsiders are sapient, others are more beastlike.

### Nature Spirits

Dark, hostile spirts made of wood, moss, stone, and bone. Hostile to all civilized life.

Can be artificially created by felling a tree at noon, then sacrificing a life over the stump at midnight.

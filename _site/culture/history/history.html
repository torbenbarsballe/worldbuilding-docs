<ul>
  <li>200,000 BC
** Common ancestor of all humanoid races rises on the Xuon continent.
*100,000 BC
** Divergence of Uon and Ældar races. Ældar migrate to Eaos plains.</li>
  <li>15,000 BC
** Early Æl‘daal civilization (Ælmos) rises in what is now the great Eaos desert. Primitive argricultural villages. 
 Initially governed by chieftens (elected?). Over the course of millenia, these villages grew and gradually became more structured.</li>
  <li>10,000 BC 
** Various hunter-gather societies move further inland. 
<em>** Some Æl‘daal migrate futher north, forming the early Æl‘mið civilization.
**</em> Other hunter-gatherer tribes begin to develip shamanic shapeshifting abilities, forming the forerunners of the ‘fae.
*** Some of the more nomadic / adventurous tribes among the southwestern fishing villages migrate to the draconic isles, forming the forerunners of the ‘xhal.</li>
  <li>8,000 BC
** Some Æl‘mið migrate west across the Dragonspine land bridge, forming the Æl’dhal civilization. Offshoot of this group settles on the Isle of the Celts.</li>
  <li>6,000 BC
** Rise of the ancient Æl’daal civilization. One of the largest Eaos villages gradually grew into a thriving city. 
 Trade was established with other burgeoning cities (as well as fishing and mining villages), and the roots of true civilization began.</li>
  <li>4,500 BC
** Æl’thal civilization: First Dynasty.
** First ascended.</li>
  <li>4000 BC
** The Eaos trade hub gradually grew into a sprawling civilization, subsuming surronding cities through economical superiority or force of arms.
** Eventually, the civilazion entered a golden age of magic and technology.
<em>** Advanced agriculture, irrigation.

  <li>3800 BC
** Queen of Ravens born.
** Research into elementalism leads to the precursors to the Æl‘jinn.</li>
  <li>3600 BC
** Midda’fae (wolves) arise from Daal’fae and ‘mið.</li>
  <li>3000 BC
** Decline of the Eos civilization. Constant farming begins to take a substantial toll on the land, resulting in scarcer resources and famine.
 This leads to harsher taxes, and greater militarization in an attemt to conquer the more fertile, primitive lands further north.
 Eaosian mages begin researcing necromancy, in an attemt to form tireless zombie soldiers with no need for food.
 Meanwhile, the opressed provinces of the Eaos empire begin openly rebelling. With the adven of zombie armies, many of these splinter groups also 
 begin to research animancy and necromancy in an attemp to combat the undead.
 First liches arise among the empires necromancy researces. The increased focus on necromantic magic leads to other liches arising among the rebelling privinces.
** Æl’jinn break off from the ‘daal.
** Uon civilization rises on Xuon.</li>
  <li>3100 BC
** Lich wars. Unrest between provinces breaks out into an all-out, multi-way war. The new liches quickly rise in prominence due to their power and near immortality. 
 New liches also arise durin this time. The war eventually devolves into liches fighting among themselves alongside thier minions. 
 Most of the common people flee north, to where it is less civilized but more stable. Over the course of the war, many liches are destroyed or imprisoned. 
 Eventually, one of the empire liches triumphs over the remaining armies. After stabilizing the remains of the empire, this lich tries to continue to expand the empire, 
 but is destroyed by the ‘jinn nation when he encroches on their borders.

<h1 id="lmos---ancient-ldaal-civilization">Ælmos - Ancient Æl’daal civilization</h1>
<p>Centered in what is now the great Eos desert. 
Ruins – mostly tombs or mausoloeams. Obelisks and large statues are common. Step pyramids rare but present. Tombs usually have undead guardians (zombies + a sleep/wake spell. Generally have ornate animal death masks. Some tombs house liches.</p>

<h1 id="uon-war">Uon War</h1>
<p>Primarily Uon vs. Æl’daal &amp; ‘jinn. Æl’fae avoided major conflicts, but some groups did participate in guerilla tactics against the Uon. A relatively small number of midh actually fought, but they did make many of the weapons for the ‘daal and ‘jinn. This may have led to the founding of the hollow cities?
Vetrans of the Uon war still alive as of 100 AC include ‘jinn, dragons, some archmagi, any immortals (Liches, eldar fae, etc.)</p>

# Illusion

Illusions allow one to deceive the senses of other beings in various ways. There are two approaches to illusion: 

## Physical Illusion

Physical illusions can be seen by anyone, and are technically real. An example would be creating or redirecting light to make phantom objects. Physical illusions primarily use channeling to redirect light, sound, etc. Evocation or transmutation can be used to create illusions not based on a nearby object.

## Mental Illusion

Mental illusions affect only certain targets, and use psionics to alter the perception of the target, making them sense things that do not exist. Mental illusions tend to be more complete and less flawed than physical illusions. However, deceiving multiple people with psychic illusions is proportionally more difficult relative to the number of targets.

Mages specializing in either type of illusion are known as Illusionists, and are most often learned mages. Instinctive illusionists are more likely to use mental illusions than physical illusions.

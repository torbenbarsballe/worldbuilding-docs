        <h1 id="artifice-enchanting">Artifice (Enchanting)</h1>

<p>Artifice refers to the creation of physical objects with magical properties, and is the primary application of the Enchanting school. There are three main types of artifacts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most basic artifacts use some constant magical effect imbued into an object. Common examples of this effect include:
    <ul>
      <li>A glass or crystal enchanted to transmute heat into light, to produce a permanent magical light source.</li>
      <li>Any object enchanted to channel force evenly across the object in order to make it stronger and more durable. This is frequently used in weapons, armor, and architecture.</li>
      <li>A blade enchanted to focus its force to a single edge, effectively making it razor sharp and immune to dulling. Most commonly used in weapons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Artifacts that have a triggered enchantment are generally more difficult to create, but are quite popular, as they allow users to create some magical effect without needing any magical skill. The most common version of this is spells stored on single-use scrolls, which are usually triggered by speaking some trigger word or phrase.</li>
  <li>The most sought after artifacts usually combine triggered effects with some constant effect. Examples include a magical wand that casts a spell whenever the trigger word is spoken, or a sword that catches fire only when is drawn from its sheath. Such artifacts are very difficult to create, and are therefore rare and valuable.</li>
  <li>Artifacts that have a template enchantment are only useful to mages, and are most often made by mages for personal use. Consequently they are fairly rare. Such enchantments are primarily applied to wands or spell books.</li>
</ul>

<p>Artifice has some overlap with metallurgy, as certain alloys hold enchantment better than others, and sympathy, as incorporating sympathetically relevant materials in an artifact can make it more effective and reliable.
Mages specializing in artifice are known as Artificers and are generally learned mages.</p>

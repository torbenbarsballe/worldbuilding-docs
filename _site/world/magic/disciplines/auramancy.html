<p>Auramancy refers to any usage of Animancy that manipulates the soul or essence of the living. The two major applications are Soultraveling and Soullinking.</p>

<h2 id="soultraveling">Soultraveling</h2>

<p>Soultravelling is an application of the Animancy and Scrying schools that allows practitioners to journey outside of their body in an invisible and incorporeal form. Scrying is used so that the soultraveller can sense their surroundings. While soultravelling, the mages ability to use magic is substantially reduced, and they are more vulnerable to soulbinding.  THe mages body appears to be in a meditative or sleep-like state, except that they cannot be awoken. If their body is killed, they will generally be stuck in an incoporeal state, with a limited ability to interact with the real world, very similar to a ghost or spirit.</p>

<h2 id="soullinking">Soullinking</h2>

<p>A mage can use animancy to create a bond between their soul and the soul of another entity. This will cause both members of the bond to take on some properties and behaviors of the other. Both members of the bond become joined in emotion and purpose, but each member still has free will. The stronger or greater mind tends to dominate the bond. 
To demonstrate how such a bond works, consider a bond between a human mage and a dog. As a result of the bond, the dog will gain greater intelligence, and will gain some insight into human behavior. The human will become more aware of their other senses, as well as pack and dominance behaviors between canines. If the dog detects something it determines to be dangerous, the human will become more alert and nervous. If the human becomes hostile towards someone or something, the dog may attack. Essentially, both members of the bond behave in concert but act independently.
Many mages prefer to bond with a relatively weak minded entity such as a bird, reptile, or lesser elemental, so that they maintain the majority of control. Bonding with a more intelligent creature such as a cat, wolf or horse will result in a companion that will contribute its own perspectives and desires, and may subconsciously influence the mage, but will generally bow to the will of the mage. Where one member of the bond is subservient to the other (as in the above two cases), it is generally called a Familiar.
Some people form such a bond between them and another person (or direbeast). Such a joining is more of a true partnership, with each member influencing the other equally. Members of such a bond are usually called Soul-partners. Direbeasts in such a bond also tend to dislike being refered to as familiars.
If a mage somehow links their soul to a dragon, elder immortal or gyldraed, they will likely find their will subservient to that of the other entity. 
If one member of the bond dies, the other will experience a mental and emotional backlash proportional to the mind of the dead member. In the case of a mage and a bird familiar, the mage would experience some mental trauma and would likely fall unconscious, but would make a full recovery if the bird died, but the bird would be driven insane or rendered brain dead if the mage died.
Many familiar bonds also allow each member to experience the senses of the other, and read the thoughts of the other, although this is technically a separate bond created using psionics.
Bonding several different familiars has a tendency to gradually subsume the mind of the mage into the linked consciousness.
A large proportion of mages, both learned and instinctive, chose to bond familiars. Shapeshifters generally do not, as they gain many of the advantages of a familiar by being able to shapeshift. Those shapeshifters who do form such a bond usually bond with an equal partner such as another shapeshifter or a direbeast rather than a lesser mind.</p>

<p>Mages who practice Auramancy are known as Auramancers, and can be instinctive or learned mages. Note that there are very few mages who solely practice Auramancy â€“ most practitioners also have other magical skills. Many Necromancers are also skilled Auramancers.</p>

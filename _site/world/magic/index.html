        <h1 id="magic">Magic</h1>

<h2 id="arcana">Arcana</h2>

<p>Arcana is the energy drawn upon to accomplish feats of magic. Generally
cannot be directly interacted with, but required for all spells.
Disruptions in Arcana will temporarily disable persistent magical
effects, but will not likely have any other detrimental effects on
magical items or entities. Arcana repels itself and will therefore tend
to spread fairly evenly across an area. Consequently, any item
enchanted to store arcane will slowly leak energy to its surroundings,
and this effect will be more significant in an area with little Arcana.
Arcana is also naturally attracted to higher energy regions, such as
living beings, rivers, fault lines, volcanoes, etc. This results in a
fairly complex distribution of magical energies across any given region.</p>

<h2 id="aether">Aether</h2>

<p>Aether is the driving force behind active magical effects, the medium
used in enchanting, and the ‘path’ used by sympathetic effects. Aether
is directly manipulated by magic users to create magical effects
(‘spells’). Disruptions to Aether can cause catastrophic magical
effects, spontaneously create magical effects and elementals, and
drastically disrupt spellcasting and active magical effects.
A magical ‘force’ can be applied to the Aether to draw Arcana towards a spellcaster in order to provide energy for a spell.</p>

<p>The power of a mage is proportional to the range from which he or she
can draw arcana from, which is equivalent to the area that he or she
can affect directly.</p>

<h2 id="schools-of-magic">Schools of Magic</h2>

<p>The practice of magic is divided into 9 schools. Each school is further
classified as Physical, Ethereal, or Arcane. Physical Magic involves
the manipulation of matter and energy. The Schools of Physical Magic
are Evocation, Channeling, and Transmutation. Ethereal Magic involves
the manipulation and observation of unseen or unreal forces. The
Schools of Ethereal Magic are Scrying, Psionics, and Animancy. Arcane
Magic involves the manipulation and usage of magic itself. The Schools
of Arcane Magic are Encantation, Sympathy, and Enchanting.</p>

<h3 id="evocantionschoolsevocation"><a href="./schools/evocation">Evocantion</a></h3>

<p>Evocation is the creation and absorption of matter and energy.</p>

<p>Evocation is generally limited to small-scale effects, as all energy for the spell must come directly from Arcana. Evocation tends to be ‘faster’ to cast than comparable channeling or transmutation effects, and is therefore useful for reactive spells. 
It is also useful for small effects that supplement more complex spells.</p>

<h3 id="channelingschoolschanelling"><a href="./schools/chanelling">Channeling</a></h3>

<p>Channeling is the transport of matter and energy from one place to another.</p>

<p>Channeling is useful for focusing large but diffuse energy sources such as ambient heat, and for redirecting forces.
More powerful spellcasters can use channeling for teleportation.</p>

<h3 id="transmutationschoolstransmutation"><a href="./schools/transmutation">Transmutation</a></h3>

<p>Transmutation is the transformation of matter and energy from one form into another.</p>

<p>Transmutation is often used for spells requiring a material that is not present, such as supplying fuel to a fireball spell. 
Transmutation is also one of the primary components of shapeshifting.</p>

<h3 id="scryingschoolsscrying"><a href="./schools/scrying">Scrying</a></h3>

<p>Scrying is the observation of that which is unseen or far away.</p>

<p>It can be used to sense magic and energy, and see through walls or other barriers. 
It can also be used to observe the past, present, future, or far away places.</p>

<h3 id="psionicsschoolsscrying"><a href="./schools/scrying">Psionics</a></h3>

<p>Psionics is the reading and manipulation of the mind.</p>

<p>Psionics can be used to view the thoughts or senses of another being, as well as project ones thoughts or senses into the mind of another being. 
It can also be used to manipulate the minds of others.</p>

<h3 id="animancyschoolsanimancy"><a href="./schools/animancy">Animancy</a></h3>

<p>Animancy is the manipulation of an entity’s soul or life essence.</p>

<p>It can be used to travel outside of one’s body in an invisible and incorporeal form, to maintain ones identity when shapeshifting into another form, and to bind souls into other vessels.</p>

<h3 id="encantationschoolsencantation"><a href="./schools/encantation">Encantation</a></h3>

<p>Encantation is the manipulation of Arcana (magical power) and Aether (magical media).</p>

<p>It can be used to attract or repel Arcana, and to disrupt or nullify magical effects.</p>

<h3 id="sympathyschoolssympathy"><a href="./schools/sympathy">Sympathy</a></h3>

<p>Sympathy the use relationships between physical things to enable other spellcasting.</p>

<p>Sympathy can be used to link two similar objects, link part of an object with the rest of it, or link an object with its past or future. 
It can be used to simplify many aspects of spellcasting, including targeting (for scrying or teleportation), templating (for physical tranmutation), or to reduce the arcana required by a spell by using a sympathetic focus of a material related to the effect of the spell.</p>

<h3 id="enchantingschoolsenchanting"><a href="./schools/enchanting">Enchanting</a></h3>

<p>Enchanting the binding of magical effect into objects.</p>

<p>This can be used to create can include single use items (potions, traps), focci that require a supply of arcana to do anything (spellbooks, certain wands), or ongoing effects (magical light sources, a flaming sword).
The Enchanting school also includes other permanent effects such as curses.</p>

<h2 id="mages">Mages</h2>

<p>Any practitioner of magic is known as a mage. Most average mages are most skilled in one or two disciplines, with much lesser skill in other fields. More powerful mages may be similarly specialized but much more skilled, or have a similar amount of skill, but in a wider range of fields.</p>

<p>Refer to spellbook for an idea of what an average mage can accomplish.
Strong mages skilled in sympathy and transmutation can obtain functional immortality by meditating for about 1 hour per day to nullify the effects of aging. Most shapeshifters also age at a reduced rate. Very powerful mages can use Animancy to achieve a stronger form of immortality (ie. lichdom).</p>

<h3 id="mage-professions">Mage Professions</h3>

<p>Most reasonably skilled mages use their skills to make a living.
The primary marketable mage skills are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alchemy</li>
  <li>Artifice</li>
  <li>Arcane Engineering</li>
  <li>Battle Magic</li>
  <li>Healing</li>
  <li>Divination – Lost items or people, futures, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many mages are also researchers at mage academies.
In smaller towns, mages (usually witches or similar) often perform a mix of services ranging from charms and potions, to healing and weather prediction.</p>

<h3 id="mage-classifications">Mage Classifications</h3>

<p>Depending on the type of magic a mage uses, and their approach to using magic, a mage may be referred to by a number of other terms.</p>

<h4 id="instinctive-magic-and-learned-magic">Instinctive Magic and Learned Magic</h4>
<p>There are two primary approaches to magic. Instinctive mages have no formal training in magic (Although they may have been taught some magic by their predecessor), and rely primarily on experience and intuition to cast spells. This tends to provide a benefit for more complex spells or those that are benefited by sympathy. However, the mage also tends to rely more on components, incantations, symbols, and other aids, whether or not they are actually necessary. Conversely, learned mages are formally trained, and have grounding in the nine schools of magic and their interactions, as well as various best practices for spellcasting. As a consequence, learned mages tend to be better at using magical power efficiently, have a finer degree of control over their spells, and are less reliant on incantations, physical components, or other aids. Learned mages also tend to be more adaptable, and have a good grasp of basic spells from among the nine schools of magic. An instinctive mage is often referred to as a Mystic, and a learned mage is commonly referred to as an Arcane. This term is sometimes used to prefix a mages specialization; for instance a Mystic Seer is a seer who uses instinctive magic, and an Arcane Metallurgist is a metallurgist who uses learned magic.</p>

<h4 id="witch">Witch</h4>
<p>Witches are instinctive magic users (male or female), favoring use practical and/or subtle magic. They usually specialize in Alchemy (Herblore), Weather Prediction, Charms/Talismans, Healing, and Curses. In general witches. Many small towns or villages have a resident witch.</p>

<h4 id="sorcerer">Sorcerer</h4>
<p>Sorcerers are instinctual magic users, favoring expressions of raw power. They specialize in kinesis, elementalism, and physical enhancement.</p>

<h4 id="shaman">Shaman</h4>
<p>Shamans are instinctive magic users, similar to a witch, but with a broader range of magic that produces active or direct effects. Often has some skill in another field, such as Necromancy, Sorcery, or Shapeshifting. Shamans are usually the prime magic user of some tribe (eg. Ael‘xhal or Daal‘fae)</p>

<h4 id="wizard">Wizard</h4>
<p>Learned magic users, favoring a logical and efficient approach to magic. Speciallize in a wide range of school; individual wizards tend to have their own speciality. Wizards try to discover how magic actually functions in order to optimize the efficiency of their magic and discover new applications. They are often skilled in encantation. Frequently used as an alternate term for any learned mage.</p>

<h2 id="magic-disciplines">Magic Disciplines</h2>
<p>While the nine schools of magic provide a good breakdown of how magic works, most functional spells use a mix of schools and methods to accomplish some effect. In order to better categorize how magic is actually used, various subclasses have been defined.
The schools of magic used by each discipline are noted. 
The use of some disciplines favor instinctive magic, while other disciplines favor learned magic. When this is not noted, it is assumed the discipline is equally accessible to either form of mage. In general, disciplines that rely mostly on sympathy (such as alchemy) or that produce a simple physical effect through fairly complex magical means (such as elementalism) tend to favor instinctive magic, while disciplines that require a great deal of precision (Such as teleportation), or rely on basic principles from one of the nine schools (Such as reinforcement) favor learned magic.</p>

<h3 id="telepathy">Telepathy</h3>

<p>Telepathy involves reading and altering the minds of others, and is the primary application of the psionics school. 
A mage specializing in telepathy is known as a Telepath or a Psion, and may be a learned or instinctive mage.</p>

<h3 id="divination">Divination</h3>

<p>Divination is the ability to see events at other places or times, and is the primary application of Scrying school. It is generally separated into Farsight (See other places), Postcognition (See the past), and Precognition (See into the future).
A mage specializing in divination is known as a Diviner or a Seer, although Seer most commonly refers to a mage who is capable of seeing into the future. Diviners and Seers are equally likely to be an instinctive magic users learned magic users.</p>

<h3 id="artificedisciplinesartifice-enchanting"><a href="./disciplines/artifice">Artifice</a> (Enchanting)</h3>

<p>Artifice refers to the creation of physical objects with magical properties, and is the primary application of the Enchanting school. 
Mages specializing in artifice are known as Artificers and are generally learned mages.</p>

<h3 id="arcanus-encantation">Arcanus (Encantation)</h3>

<p>Arcanus is the manipulation of magic to disrupt, block or amplify magical effects, and is the primary application of the Encantation school. This discipline includes:</p>

<h4 id="magic-gathering">Magic Gathering</h4>

<p>This discipline encompasses the gathering of Arcana to oneself. It is to some degree natural to all mages, although mages skilled in encantation can gather magic in substantially greater quantities.</p>

<h4 id="magic-repulsion">Magic Repulsion</h4>

<p>This includes any form of repulsion of Arcana from an area, rendering anyone in the affected area unable to use magic. A more precise application of this ability can create a shielded area that cannot be affected by magic.</p>

<h4 id="dispelling-and-disenchanting">Dispelling and Disenchanting</h4>

<p>This discipline involves the disruption of Aether to stop a spell or destroy an enchantment.
Because it requires a certain amount of knowledge of the behavior of magic, it favors learned magic. Mages specializing in this school of magic are known as Encanters or Arcanus.</p>

<h3 id="alchemydisciplinesalchemy"><a href="./disciplines/alchemy">Alchemy</a></h3>

<p>Alchemy is essentially chemistry applied to natural and magical materials. It includes the creation of any materials with magical properties. While in many ways similar to enchanting, it differs in that Enchanting is the application of any given affect to some object, whereas Alchemy is the creation of some effect using the existing properties of various materials. Consequently, Alchemists do not need to have any magical skill, although magic (primarily sympathy and enchanting) can be used to identify, supplement, or enhance certain effects.
Basic alchemy favors instinctive magic, and most nonmagical alchemists gradually develop some basic magical power, which manifests in the form of more powerful or more perfect substances.
A mage specializing in alchemy is known as an Alchemist, or more specifically as a Metallurgist or an Herbalist. Metallurgists are most commonly learned mages while Herbalists are most commonly instinctive mages, although most Herbalists do have an extensive knowledge of the natural effects of all the ingredients they use.</p>

<h3 id="healingdisciplineshealing"><a href="./disciplines/healing">Healing</a></h3>

<p>Healing is the use of magic to heal illness or injuries. Healing primarily uses sympathy, with some transmutation and channeling. Basic healing uses sympathy and transmutation to restore the body to the state it was in before the injury, similar to how shapeshifting works. This is most effective on minor injuries. More complex injures require more effort and guidance on the part of the healer to avoid complications, and as such rely more heavily on channeling and transmutation. 
Mages specializing in Healing are known as Healers and are usually learned mages.</p>

<h3 id="illusiondisciplinesillusion"><a href="./disciplines/illusion">Illusion</a></h3>

<p>Illusions allow one to deceive the senses of other beings in various ways.
Mages specializing in illusion are known as Illusionists, and are most often learned mages. Instinctive illusionists are more likely to use mental illusions than physical illusions.</p>

<h3 id="kinesis">Kinesis</h3>

<p>Kinesis is the practice of magic to make physical objects move. 
Acceleration and levitation of objects and people primarily uses evocation. Animation and deformation of solids primarily uses transmutation. Manipulation of fluids uses evocation and transmutation.</p>

<h4 id="elementalism">Elementalism</h4>

<p>Elementalism is Kinesis applied to a single element, (i.e. air, fire, water, or earth).  Such mages are usually referred to as Aerokinetics, Geokinetics, Hydrokinetics, or Pyrokinetics depending on their preferred element.</p>

<p>Different forms of kinesis tend to be suited to different types of spellcasters: Elementalism is favored by more instinctive mages, whereas the more precise applications of kinesis such as flight or rapid projectiles are favored by learned mages. All forms of Kinesis tend to be relatively power intensive, and are usually used sparingly. A mage who specializes in Kinesis but does not use any single element is known as a Kinetic or a Telekinetic.</p>

<h3 id="shapeshiftingdisciplinesshapeshifting"><a href="./disciplines/shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</a></h3>

<p>Shapeshifting is the transformation of ones body into a different form. This can include altering one’s surface appearance as a form of disguise, or transforming completely into another species. Mages who shapeshift frequently age at about half the rate they would age naturally.
A mage who practices shapeshifting is known as a Shapeshifter.</p>

<h3 id="augumency">Augumency</h3>

<p>Augemency is any application of the Chanelling school used to strengthen or enhance an object or entity. This school uses channeling to evenly distribute forces on an object to make it more durable or focus forces to a more precise location to make it more effective. This type of magic is useful for combat, making flesh and armor more durable while also making weapons more effective. It can also be used to enhance the strength, speed and durability of a person.
Augumency is commonly combined with enchanting to make sharper weapons and more durable armor. A mage who practices Augumency is known as an Augumencer and is generally a learned mage.</p>

<h3 id="auramancydisciplinesauramancy"><a href="./disciplines/auramancy">Auramancy</a></h3>

<p>Auramancy refers to any usage of Animancy that manipulates the soul or essence of the living. 
It can be used to seperate a soul from a body, or to link two souls together.
Mages who practice Auramancy are known as Auramancers, and can be instinctive or learned mages. Note that there are very few mages who solely practice Auramancy – most practitioners also have other magical skills. Many Necromancers are also skilled Auramancers.</p>

<h3 id="necromancydisciplinesnecromancy"><a href="./disciplines/necromancy">Necromancy</a></h3>

<p>Necromancy refers to any usage of Animancy that manipulates the soul or essence of the (un)dead. Necromancy is primarily concerned with the reanimation of corpses or spirits.
A mage specializing in necromancy is known as a Necromancer, and is generally a learned mage.</p>

<h3 id="translocation">Translocation</h3>

<p>Translocation refers to any application of the channeling school to transport entities without having them cross the intervening distance. While the primary application of this is teleportation, it also includes items such as Bags of Holding, which store items in some location, and use teleportation to retrieve them as needed. Manipulation of time and space are often also included in this category, although they are not used very much, due too the extreme amounts energy required for even very minor effects. Favors learned magic.</p>

<h3 id="oversight">Oversight</h3>

<p>This discipline uses small tweaks in physical properties to trigger potent natural effects such as storms or earthquakes. Scrying is used to determine the composition of whatever complex system the caster is manipulation, and to determine what should be done to get the desired effect. Channeling and transmutation, and sometimes evocation or short-term enchanting is used to trigger these effects. This discipline tends to be unreliable and difficult to use, and spells usually require a great deal of time to take effect. The upside is that spellcasters can trigger very powerful effects with very little energy expenditure.
A mage who practices this type of magic is known as an Overseer (pronounced overseer rather than oversee-er)</p>

<h2 id="mage-cant">Mage Cant</h2>

<p>Most mages use various runes and sigils to help focus their spells or enchantments. While this is not required, it does tend to make spellcasting easer, and therefore is commonly taught by most mage schools. This has caused the rise of a number of runic scripts known as Mage Cants. The major mage cants are:
The old Ældar script commonly used by Æl’jinn, and Æl’fae, as well as any still living Ældar (eg. Æl’syi, High fae, etc.)
A modern variation of this script is used by the Æl’daal
A variation of the Futhark is used by the Æl’midh.
A variation of the western language (which is itself a logographic script consisting of thousands of characters) used by the Æl’dhal.
The Uon use a unique set of runelike paterns on all their enchanted items, unrelated to any other script.</p>

<h2 id="savants">Savants</h2>

<p>Many individuals are born with natural magical abilities. This most often occurs if their parents (especially their mother) were skilled in such abilities and used them frequently. This can also occur spontaneously in areas where magic is used regularly. For example, many people born near some of the larger magical academies can see magic, and many Riftlander children have a natural resistance to magic. This process is also responsible for the evolution of the Uon, ‘fae, and ‘djinn into their modern forms, and has also had some effect on dragons, allowing them to fly when their size should prevent it, and consequently accommodating the evolution of very large dragons.</p>

<p>Savant abilities are usually subtle or simple, and most often develop gradually over several generations. A very dramatic example of a magical savant is natural shapeshifters.</p>

<p>Note: Some rare animal savants exist (eg. ‘Nightmares’, Firemane lion).</p>

<h2 id="magical-servants">Magical Servants</h2>

<p>Many mages find it useful to have magical servants that can defend them or help them accomplish certain tasks. Since mages tend to specialize in a certain type of magic, different mages have very different approaches to acquiring such servants.</p>

<h3 id="familiars">Familiars</h3>

<p>Familiars are creatures whose soul is magically linked to that of the mage using animancy. Animal familiars are favored by witches. Elemental familiars are favored by Sorcerers and Ellementalists. Shamans and Wizards may use animal or elemental familiers, or another form of magical servant.
Dominated
Powerful psions are capable of altering the mind of another being to force them into servitude. This is very difficult to accomplish (although easier with animals as opposed to people), and generally considered immoral. As such, dominated are relatively rare. The Order of Sion employs some dominated servants and sleeper agents.</p>

<h3 id="zombies">Zombies</h3>

<p>A mage can use animancy to capture an imprint or magical memory of a once living being and use this imprint to reanimate their body, creating an undead entity which will behave similar to how it did in life, but have no actual soul or guiding intelligence. As they have no true will of their own and are instead guided by instinct, zombies make decent servants. However, imprinted undead will only be effective at tasks that they were good at in life. Reanimation of zombies is often considered immoral as it seen as a desecration of the deceased corpse. Zombies are primarily employed by necromrancers, often in large numbers. Zombies are also found in many AElmos tombs.</p>

<h3 id="revenants">Revenants</h3>

<p>A sufficiently skilled mage can use animancy to permanently bind the soul of a living being into their body or another repository. This is easiest at the moment of death of the natural body of the soul in question, and unlike imprinting cannot be done if the target entity is already dead. Revenants retain all knowledge, skills and abilities they had in life, and are fundamentally the same person as they where when alive.
Since revenants retain free will and are more difficult to create than zombies, revenants are used as servants much less often than zombies. Revenants are usually warriors or mages serving a powerful lich, in both life and undeath.</p>

<h3 id="soulbound-elementals">Soulbound Elementals</h3>

<p>Soulbinding can be used to trap the essence of an elemental into an object, in order to create items that can be used to “summon” the captured elemental. While the mage can control the summoning of the elemental, they generally have little control over the elemental after it has been summoned.</p>

<h3 id="null-golem">Null Golem</h3>

<p>A null golem is an artificially created construct that can be controlled remotely by its creator, using a combination of animancy and scrying. Remotely controlled corpses also fall into this category. Note that null golems are substantially more common than imprinted or soulbound golems, whereas conventional zombies are substantially more common than null zombies.
Null golems must stay within a certain range of their controller to function. Null golems require a complex array of enchantments so that they can move at the command of their creator. Without these enchantments, the controller of the golem would have to use evocation and transmutation to move the golem, which would be infeasible, especially over long distances. Null golems are most often used by Artificers. Null zombies are usually used by necromancers for scouting purposes. Mages that make frequent use of null golems often eventually permanently transfer their soul into a golem body.</p>

<h3 id="automaton">Automaton</h3>

<p>Automatons are artificial magical constructs created using enchanting. This includes something as simple as a magelight that will follow around whomever is carrying a control focus, to a magical book sorting system. The behavior of magical automations is analogous to that of a computer program – they will follow a prescribed set of rules, but cannot learn or adapt. Additionally, enchanting is not well suited to creating large complex “programs”, so most automatons are fairly primitive. Mage script and other similar diagrams are generally used to encode the behavior of more complex automations, so that the creator can more easily see exactly how everything works. No sapient automatons have ever been created, although they are in theory possible (a naturally occurring example of a purely magical consciousness is any greater elemental). Automatons are generally used by Artificers. Simple automatons may be used by other types of mages as well.</p>

# Calender

The unique cosmology of this world leads to an equally unique calender.

Each week is 6 days long. This is the same as the orbital period of the
Sun and the Darksun.

Each month is 36 days (6 weeks). This is the orbital period of the
Coppermoon.

Each year is 252 days (7 months; 42 weeks). The beginning of each year
coincides with a full alignment of the three moons.

| Month | Common Name | Translated Name | Convergence events |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|     
| 1     | Divergence  | 'Birth'         | Full convergence at day 0 |
| 2     |             | 'Honor'         | Copper/Gold convergence at day 27 |
| 3     |             | 'Forgetfullness'| Copper/Silver convergence at day 9 |
| 4     |             | 'Truth'         | Copper/Gold convergence, and Silver anticonvergence at day 18 |
| 5     |             | 'Secrecy'       | Copper/Silver convergence at day 27 |
| 6     |             | 'Valor'         | Copper/Gold convergence at day 9 |
| 7     | Convergence | 'Completion'    | Full convergence at day 36 |
      
The Sun and Darksun each take 6 days (1 week) to orbit the planet. The
coppermoon takes 36 days

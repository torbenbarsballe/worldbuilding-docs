        <h1 id="world-cosmology">World Cosmology</h1>

<p>Earth-centric, orbited by various celestial bodies all 1/10th the
diameter of the earth. Orbiting spheres are all uniform and lifeless.
Past a few light-years, the fabric of spacetime frays into
non-Euclidean folding that makes it seem as if you are moving without
actually going anywhere. Parallel universes may exist, and pocket
dimensions are possible (As demonstrated by parts of the Riftscape)</p>

<p>This geocentric structure gives a short solar year (1 week). This
(coupled with
a neglegible axial tilt) means that there is no real seasonal climate
variation. Instead, the climate and the seasons are controlled by
elementals. Also, this means that there are no real lunar phases.
Additionally, since the sun is inside of the orbit of the moons, there
are no solar eclipses.
The major celestial bodies all manifest as some element on earth. Each
celestial shpere is comprised primarily of this material (plus
impurities, meteor impacts, oxidization, etc.). They are also covered with arcane geometric patterns.</p>

<p>Beyond the major celestial bodies there is a background of stars and celestial dust (comets, meteors, dust, gas, etc.)</p>

<h2 id="great-spheres-suns---oposing-orbits-orbital-period-of-6-days">Great Spheres (“Suns”) - Oposing orbits. Orbital period of 6 days.</h2>
<p>Orbits approx &lt;&gt; m from the planet. Sky diameter of 33’.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sunfire - Fragile, transparent crystal. Rapidly breaks down at low
pressures (less than 1000 atm) or regions of low arcana, emmiting
massive amounts of heat, light, and arcana. Due to this, it is
extremely rare on earth and rarely lasts for long.</li>
  <li>Darkstone - Brittle, opaque black crystal. Excludes arcana and aether.
Durable, but explodes violently if damaged, releasing a burst of arcana.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lesser-spheres-moons">Lesser Spheres (“Moons”)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Aurum - Gold. Good Enchanting medium. Orbital period of 36 days. Orbits approx &lt;&gt; m from the planet. Sky diameter of 9.5’.</li>
  <li>Argent - Silver. Disruptive to magic. Orbital period of 63 days. Orbits approx &lt;&gt; m from the planet. Sky diameter of 6.6’.</li>
  <li>Alkyne - Copper. Imprints/stores magical signatures. Orbital period of
84 days. Orbits approx &lt;&gt; m from the planet. Sky diameter of 5.4’.</li>
</ul>

<p>The three lesser spheres come into convergence every 252 days. The <a href="./calender">Daes calender</a> is based upon this convergence.</p>

<p>???:</p>

<p>Eternity - Iron.
Essence - Starmetal. Highly sensitive to magic, and will fload in areas
of strong arcana. Responsible for the magical properties of meteoric
iron.
Clarity - Diamond</p>

<p>Firenze - Sulfer-Methane gas giant. Red-orange.
Aqua - Hydrogen-Oxygen gas giant. Blue-orange.
Aeris - Oxygen-Nitrogen gas giant. Yellow.
Gaius - Silicon-Carbon-Oxide planet. Gray-green.</p>

<p>Celestial Dust: Stars and Meteors
The celestial dust is made of shards of the celestial spheres. Stars
are comprised primarily of starfire shards, with their colors
determined by impurities. Most meteors are comprised of fragments of
the lesser spheres.</p>
